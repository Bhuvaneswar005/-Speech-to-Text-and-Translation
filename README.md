# Speech-to-Text and Translation Project

This Python project utilizes IBM Cloud APIs to convert speech to text and then translates the text into Spanish.

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of the integration of IBM Cloud services to perform two key tasks:
1. Convert spoken language into text using the IBM Speech-to-Text service.
2. Translate the resulting text into Spanish using the IBM Language Translator service.

## Usage

You can use this project to transcribe spoken content and obtain Spanish translations. The code is written in Python and uses IBM Cloud APIs to achieve these tasks.
